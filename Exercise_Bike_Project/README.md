## Welcome to my <em>Exercise Bike</em> Project repository!

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è About 
Here you will find materials from a SolidWorks project related to recreating an exercise bike, undertaken during my academic journey in Mechanical Engineering.

In this project, I aimed to replicate an exercise bike using SOLIDWORKS¬Æ 2020 CAD software, based on the HC 3015 model by Kikos¬Æ. During the assembly process, all electronic components were excluded, and certain mechanical parts were simplified, such as removing axles and bearings from the pedals. The final assembly comprises 27 non-standardized parts, divided among group members based on complexity.

Additionally, the project involved calculations necessary for accurate modeling, including tolerance adjustments to ensure precise component fitting. Although the final version of the exercise bike lacks all features for real-world operation, it maintains structural stability.
